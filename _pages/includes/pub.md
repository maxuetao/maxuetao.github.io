[Problem-Solving Logic Guided Curriculum In-Context Learning for LLMs Complex Reasoning]() \\
**Xuetao Ma**, Wenbin Jiang, Hua Huang. \\
*Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*, 2025.

<!-- [**Project**](https://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong> -->

- We propose a problem-solving logic guided curriculum in-context learning strategy that selects and orders examples by analyzing the problem-solving logic, effectively enhancing the reasoning performance and efficiency of LLMs.
